What is the result of this project?
In this project I made a website that shows an analog clock. It has an hour, a minute and a second hand. The clock shows the current time.

How did this come about?
I worked with an HTML, a CSS and a JS file. The task was to create the JS and CSS files without editing the HTML file.

How to run this projekt?
Open the HTML-file in your browser.

JavaScript:
JavaScript is primarily there to calculate how many degrees the pointers should be so that they show the correct time.
It also has a CSS transformation that rotates the clock hands by the previously calculated degrees.

CSS:
I specified a few things in the CSS file, such as the color and position of an element of the clock.
