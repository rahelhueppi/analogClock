What is the result of this project?
In this project I made a website that shows an analog clock. It has an hour, a minute and a second hand. The clock shows the current time.

How did this come about?
I worked with an HTML, a CSS and a JS file. The task was to create the JS and CSS files without editing the HTML file.
JavaScript is primarily there to calculate how many degrees the pointers should be so that they show the correct time.

How to run this projekt?
Open the HTML-file in your browser.
